Community mods for Overload
https://github.com/overload-development-community/olmod

Overload is a registered trademark of Revival Productions, LLC.  This is an
unaffiliated, unsupported tool.  Use at your own risk.

How to run
----------

- Extract olmod in the Overload main directory
  (where `Overload.exe` / `Overload.x86_64` / `Overload.app` is also located).
  
- On linux / mac, execute `chmod +x olmod.sh` from the terminal after changing to the correct directory.
  For example after `cd "~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Overload"`

- Run `olmod.exe` / `olmod.sh` (linux / mac) instead of `Overload.exe`

  On mac you might get a warning about `olmod.dylib`, you can add an exception in
  System Preferences, Security & Privacy, General.

- Use `olmodserver.bat` / `olmodserver.sh` (linux) to start a LAN server,
  use `olmodserverinet.bat` / `olmodserverinet.sh` (linux) to start an
  internet server. For the internet server you need to open UDP port range
  7000-8001

What does it do
---------------

- Allows access to the unfinished Monsterball multiplayer mode (with tweaks by terminal). The Monsterball multiplayer mode only works when both server and clients run olmod.

- Puts a MP player in observer mode if it uses a pilot name starting with OBSERVER. The observer mode only works when the server and the observer client run olmod.

- Reads `<level name>-projdata.txt` / `<level name>-robotdata.txt` for levels, `<mission name>-projdata.txt` / `<level name>-robotdata.txt` for missions, and `projdata.txt` / `robotdata.txt` in the olmod directory for testing.  These files can have custom projectile (weapon) and robot settings. You can extract the stock data from the game with the included tool `olgetdata`. The txt files must be in the same directory as olmod.exe. You can run olgetdata on linux with `mono olgetdata.exe`. They can either go in the olmod directory, or map makers can add them to their map .zip files.

How does it work
----------------

The regular Overload.exe just runs UnityMain from UnityPlayer.dll.  The
replacement olmod.exe also runs UnityMain, but intercepts calls from Unity
to the mono C# engine to also load GameMod.dll.  The file GameMod.dll
contains a C# class that uses Harmony to modify the game scripting code in
memory.
