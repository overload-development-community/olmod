    /// This patch skips the client side resimulation if we detect that our positon
    /// and rotation we had in the past at some tick does not differ from the
    /// position and rotation the server sent back to us for that particular tick.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Client.ReconcileServerPlayerState is called at every fixed physics tick
    /// it will replay the local simulation from the last packet we've seen
    /// from the server.
    ///
    /// This means that we get a ping-dependent amount of physics resimulation steps
    /// at each single physics tick, which can be be quite expensive.
    ///
    /// However, the resimulation is only necessary if the ship's state seen by the
    /// server differs from our client's view (for example by collisions with
    /// other ships or being hit by projectiles, which aren't accurate on the client
    /// due to the lag).
    ///
    /// NOTE: we do not compare any other members of the PlayerState here.
    /// The rationale behind this is that in practice, the server never really
    /// changes those without also affecting position and rotation, and even if
    /// it does, it will lead to a positional or rotational error during one of the
    /// next ticks, so the sync will happen anyway, just one or two ticks later.
