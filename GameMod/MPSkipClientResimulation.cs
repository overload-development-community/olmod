        //
        // This means that we get a ping-dependent amount of physics resimulation steps
        // at each single physics tick, which can be be quite expensive.
        //
        // However, the resimulation is only necessary if the ship's state seen by the
        // server differs from our client's view (for example by collisions with
        // other ships or being hit by projectiles, which aren't accurate on the client
        // due to the lag).
        //
        // This patch skips the client side resimulation if we detect that our positon
        // and rotation we had in the past at some tick does not differ from the
        // position and rotation the server sent back to us for that particular tick.
        //
        // NOTE: we do not compare any other members of the PlayerState here.
        // The rationale behind this is that in practice, the server never really
        // changes those without also affecting position and rotation, and even if
        // it does, it will lead to a positional or rotational error during one of the
        // next ticks, so the sync will happen anyway, just one or two ticks later.
